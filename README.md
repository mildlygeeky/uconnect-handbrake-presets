Handbrake Preset file(s) for UConnect Theatre

Full credit goes to the folks over at [pacificaforums.com](https://www.pacificaforums.com/threads/uconnect-movies-via-usb-what-format.11914/), and especially to [jbebel](https://www.pacificaforums.com/members/jbebel.43290/) - only adding here so that I can stop searching through multi-year threads with others who are trying to get movies/shows onto their minivans' screens.

Pull requests welcome.
